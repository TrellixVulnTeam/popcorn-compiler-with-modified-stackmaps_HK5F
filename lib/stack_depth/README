Overview

The stack depth library can be used to profile the call behavior of an
application.  It records which functions were called and the depth of a
thread's call stack for each function call in the application.  It generates a
data file at the end of an application's execution containing this information,
which can be parsed by the script in util/scripts/stack-depth-info.py.  It
generates statistic like maximum stack depth, most called functions, who called
each function, etc.

To use the library, applications should be compiled with the
"-finstrument-functions" flag and linked against the library.  Running the
application will automatically generate a stack_depth.dat file containing
statistics which are parsed by stack-depth-info.py.
