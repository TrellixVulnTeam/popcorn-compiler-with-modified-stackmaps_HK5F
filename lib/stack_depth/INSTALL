Installing libstack-depth
-------------------------

NOTE: binaries cannot be linked against both libstack-depth and libmigration
because they provide different implementations of the same functions

This library is only suitable for vanilla applications.  Currently, it is only
compiled for x86-64.

1. Build & install libstack-depth for x86_64:

  $ make install

2. To generate stack statistics, run the application to generate the data file
   and pass it to the stack-depth-info.py script:

  $ ./<binary> # Will automatically generate stack_depth.dat
  $ ./util/scripts/stack-depth-info.py -d ./stack_depth.dat ...
