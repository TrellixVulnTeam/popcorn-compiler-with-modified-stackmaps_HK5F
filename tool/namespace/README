Overview

The namespace tools allow users to enter the heterogeneous container and to
launch migratable applications.  The tools allow a user to enter the "Popcorn
namespace", which has added functionalities for migration (see "APPLICATIONS"
for more details on building & running multi-ISA binaries).  These tools
automate the process of launching a new namespace and converting it into a
heterogeneous container.

NOTE: you *must* be root to enter the Popcorn namespace

To enter a heterogeneous container (after building the tools):

- Run the "launch_ns.sh" script:

  $ sudo su
  $ ./launch_ns.sh
  launching a new namespace -cimnpu

- This spawns a child in the namespace, which brings up a rudimentary shell
  (note that it doesn't have environment variables, auto-complete, etc.).  Run
  the "popcorn.sh" script to bring up a fully-functioning shell:

  $ ./popcorn.sh
  switching to popcorn ns!

You now have a bash shell running inside of the heterogeneous container, which
can be used to launch multi-ISA binaries capable of migration.
